# NissanDefinitions
A2L Supported Nissan and Infiniti ROMs. 

# Disclaimer

While these definitions appear to be fully functional, I cannot guarantee that the conversion worked without flaws for every definition file. There is a possibility that some ROMs will have errors. 

# About

The main purpose of this is to allow people to utilize a redacted variant of my A2L template, which ensures maximum compatibility across all currently defined ROMs. These definition files are not guaranteed to be accurate, as I did not make the majority of these definition files, I merely converted them to be A2L compatible. So if mistakes were made by the original contributer, then those mistakes are still present. On top of this, others can contribute to the repository. So you accept full responsibility for any and all damages that occur. If something looks funky, definitely be extremely cautious.

# Instructions 

To begin using these definitions, download and unzip the repository to wherever you want. Then inside of the "Nissan Definitions" folder, run the "combine_all.bat" file to combine all of the definition files into "Nissandefs.xml" Then inside of RomRaider, click "Definitions" -> "Definition File Manager" -> "Add" and then select the "Nissandefs.xml" file from the folder. 

I'd highly recommend checking out CF48D.bin if you're unfamiliar with the A2L template, as it's the most defined Nissan ROM. However, do note that this is a redacted variant of the A2L template. So only a handful of the total maps defined for CF48D will be visible. This is due to rapid development, custom patching, and so forth making it incompatible with the redacted A2L template.. But as time goes on, and functionality is better understood, more and more maps will be added to this redacted template. CF48D is from an 06 Nissan 350z USDM (SH7058), so it can be used to cross reference most Nissan ROMs as well. 

# Functionality

I hope that by providing A2L support for all ROMs, that it'll allow the community to better understand the interworkings of our ECU's.

If you have any questions, you can PM me, post on the General Nissan RomRaider Forums (https://www.romraider.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=45), or post within my A2L template discussion (https://www.romraider.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=17365). I would highly recommend that you post on the forums rather than PM'ing, as others will be able to benefit and contribute as well.
