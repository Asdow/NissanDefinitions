A2L Supported Nissan 350z and Infiniti G35 ROM's. This will primarily be 350z based, however. 

# About

These addresses, axes, etc are not 100% guaranteed to be accurate. If something looks funky, let me know! I will be continiously updating these files, so I'm sure to slip up here and there. I will attempt to provide all critical maps/tables/values and RAM parameters such as not to take up too much space, but also providing the important parameters required to successfully tune. 

Do note that you need a J2534 cable in order to use the RomRaider logger! A cheaper alternative is NissanDatascan 2, but it doesn't support extended parameters.
